# Book Template 

Hi all! 

This is my course template to create learning material in a uniform way. 

This template uses [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), that is a wonderful tool built by the Rust community, free to use a with a lot of great features.

Please feel free to use or modify this template! Happy teaching!
